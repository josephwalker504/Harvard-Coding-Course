        <h1 id="meet3">Meet the 3 Little Lemons</h1>
        <p>In A sun-drenched neighborhood of Antioch TN, three young entrepreneurs were hard at work. There was eight-year-old Zoié, the visionary and chief strategist, always sketching new marketing ideas on napkins. Her seven-year-old sister, Kloé, was the meticulous accountant, carefully tallying every nickel and dime in their sparkly pink ledger. And then there was six-year-old Jordynn, the bubbly sales expert, whose infectious giggle could charm even the most reluctant customer into buying an extra cup.</p>
        <p> Their business, "3 Little Lemons," wasn't just a summer pastime; it was a serious venture with a clear, sparkling goal: Disneyland! For two glorious years, ever since Zoie first declared, "Let's be our own bosses!" after watching Mom and Dad, who are entrepreneurs, they decided to pour their hearts (and plenty of lemons and sugar) into their stand.</p>
        <p>The girls adored the idea of being their own boss. There were no bedtimes dictated by grown-ups when they were discussing new flavor concoctions, no limits on how many sprinkles they could add to their "premium" cups, and every decision, from pricing to pitcher-polishing, was theirs alone. They learned about supply and demand, customer service, and the sweet taste of earned success, all while dreaming of Mickey Mouse ears and thrilling roller coasters. Their little lemonade stand wasn't just selling drinks; it was brewing big dreams, one refreshing cup at a time.</p>
